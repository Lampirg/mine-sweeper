# mine-sweeper
My variation of mine sweeper on Java.

Main part of the code was not made with Git technologies.

Was created in NetBeans with Java 8.

Graphics were not the part I was interested in, so the swing part was made with help of NetBean's visual designer (and it's pretty crooked).

Creating new game using Settings will create a game 6x6 with 10 mines despite parameters putted in labels. It also does not destroy old game, it just make it invisible.
